🤖 Human Following Robot
A 4-wheeled Arduino robot that detects a person in front of it and follows them — steering left or right to stay centered, stopping when it gets close, and sweeping its ultrasonic sensor to search when it loses track.

Built on an Arduino Uno, an L298N motor driver, two IR obstacle sensors, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a servo that pans the ultrasonic sensor to scan for a target.

✨ Features
Distance-based following — keeps a set gap from the person using the ultrasonic sensor
Left/right steering — two IR sensors detect which side the person has drifted to
Auto-stop — halts when the person gets closer than a safe distance
Search mode — sweeps the servo left/right to relocate the person if they're lost
Fully tunable — speeds and distance thresholds are simple variables at the top of the code

⚙️ How it works
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to whatever is directly ahead.
If that distance is within FOLLOW_DISTANCE, the robot considers a person "detected":
If only the left IR sensor is triggered → turn left.
If only the right IR sensor is triggered → turn right.
If neither/both are triggered → drive straight forward.
If the distance drops below STOP_DISTANCE → stop.
If nothing is detected for SEARCH_DELAY milliseconds, the robot stops and sweeps the servo left and right, checking distance at each side to try to reacquire the person.
Ultrasonic sees person? ── No ──► Stop + sweep servo to search
        │ Yes
        ▼
Too close? ── Yes ──► Stop
        │ No
        ▼
Left IR only? ── Yes ──► Turn left
        │ No
        ▼
Right IR only? ── Yes ──► Turn right
        │ No
        ▼
    Drive forward
🚀 Getting started
Wire the robot according to the pin connections table above.
Install the Arduino IDE (download here) and make sure the built-in Servo library is available (it ships with the IDE by default).
Open human_following_robot.ino in the Arduino IDE.
Select Tools → Board → Arduino Uno and the correct Port.
Click Upload.
Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to watch live distance and sensor readings while you test.
🎛️ Tuning parameters
All of these are plain variables near the top of the sketch — no need to touch the logic below them:

Variable	Default	What it does
STOP_DISTANCE	15 cm	How close the person can get before the robot halts
FOLLOW_DISTANCE	40 cm	Max distance the robot still considers "following range"
BASE_SPEED	160 (0–255)	Motor speed when driving straight forward
TURN_SPEED	140 (0–255)	Motor speed while steering left/right
SEARCH_DELAY	1500 ms	How long to wait with nothing detected before searching
IR_ACTIVE_STATE	LOW	Flip to HIGH if your IR sensors report backwards

🔮 Possible improvements
Replace the two IR sensors with a servo-mounted ultrasonic sweep for smoother, more precise angle tracking
Add a PID controller for smoother speed/turning instead of fixed speeds
Add a battery voltage monitor to prevent over-discharge
Swap IR obstacle sensors for a proper IR/PIR human-presence sensor to reduce false positives
